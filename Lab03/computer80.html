        The main use for home computers was, of course, games. As cool games may not be valid reason for purchasing and expensive gadget a wide variety of potential uses were invented to satisfy those family members who might otherwise be sceptical.

        The hardware charateristics of a home computer could be defined by its graphics and sound capabilities, CPU, and amount of memory.

        There are two types of memory:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>RAM</dt>
        <dd>Random access memory. The memory usable by programs. The amount was typically in the ballpark of 20 to 64 kilobytes. However, the Basic interpreter by default consumed a part of this</dd>
        
        <dt>ROM</dt>
        <dd>Read-only memory. This was normally smaller in size than RAM and roughly corresponded to the hardware implementation of the operating system.</dd>
